# Google-Data-Analytics 🎖️

This repository is for my Google Data Analytics **[#Google Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/home)** capstone project. 

You can find my report that I'm using in this repository. However, the data itself is quite large, I have it stored in my **[google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YPct-0kH3vjUKxRxOVTd1GTs7wXrxMnr)** if you want to look at it.
## Things I have learned through the course 👩‍🎓

- Prepare and clean data set. 📚
- Learn and have a basic knowledge about Tablaeu. 📊
- Learn the basics of RStudio, applying RStudio to a capstone project (requires additional learning besides the course). 🌌
